**Descripotion** <br>
Malaria is an infectious disease caused by a blood parasite. According to WHO statistics there were 262 million malaria cases detected in 2000. Detecting this disease from the given cell image can help the health care system in the world. In this application, we are using a  CNN architecture that gives the same classification accuracy as the VGG-16 and Resnet-50 models for thin blood smear RBC slide images for detection of malaria while decreasing the computational run time by an order of magnitude.

**Objectives** <br>
In this project, for the malaria images cell dataset we are building a deep neural network that can detect malaria. <br>
In the real-time world, this application can be able to save human lives by detecting malaria from a cell image. <br>
This model takes a cell image as the input and returns the class label(infected or uninfected) as the output. <br>
We have developed a website that can be accessible to everyone when deployed on the internet.<br>

**Scope** <br>
This application can help the health care system to detect the malaria-infected cells from the images of patients.<br>
This application can help the common public to determine if they are infected with malaria or not using their cell images.
<br>
In future, we are going to add audio and translation to the website which can add inclusivity to the website.<br>
